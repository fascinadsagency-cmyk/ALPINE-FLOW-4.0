<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to implement two new features in the application:
1.  **Proactive Blocking System**: When a user reaches their plan's limit (e.g., for creating clients, articles, or team members), the system should block the action and display a pop-up prompting them to upgrade their plan.
2.  **My Account Section**: A new section in the application where users can edit their profile information (name, email) and change their password.

The user has confirmed that both features should be implemented.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish

**what currently exists?**
The agent has implemented the backend logic for both requested features and has set up the basic file structure for the frontend.

*   **Backend**:
    *   New endpoints for profile management () and password change () have been added to .
    *   The creation endpoints for customers (), articles (), and team members () in their respective route files have been modified. They now check the user's plan limits and return a specific  error with a JSON body () when a limit is reached.
    *   The  endpoint has been updated to return the actual user limit based on the current plan.

*   **Frontend**:
    *   Placeholder components for the My Account section have been created: , , and .
    *   A link to Mi Cuenta (My Account) has been added to the main sidebar in .

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was adding the Mi Cuenta (My Account) navigation link to the application's sidebar. This involved modifying . The next logical step was to add the corresponding route in  and implement the component's functionality.
*   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done**: N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Frontend testing agent
*   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no outstanding bugs or issues. The pending work consists of completing the implementation of the requested features.

**In progress Task List**:
*   **Task 1: Complete the My Account Frontend Implementation (P0)**
    *   **Where to resume**:
        1.  Add the new route for  in  to render the  component.
        2.  Implement the UI and logic within , , and . This includes creating forms, handling state, and making API calls to the new backend endpoints (, ).
    *   **What will be achieved with this?**: Users will be able to view and update their profile information and change their password from the UI.
    *   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both

*   **Task 2: Implement the Frontend Upgrade Modal (P1)**
    *   **Where to resume**:
        1.  Create a global modal component for the upgrade prompt.
        2.  Modify the frontend's API handling logic (e.g., in an Axios interceptor or a dedicated API service) to specifically catch the  error with the  payload.
        3.  When this specific error is detected, trigger the display of the upgrade modal, which should inform the user they've hit a limit.
    *   **What will be achieved with this?**: The application will proactively block users from exceeding their plan limits and guide them towards upgrading.
    *   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
There are no other upcoming or future tasks requested by the user.

**Completed work in this session**
*   **Backend**:
    *   Created profile update and password change endpoints in .
    *   Implemented limit-checking logic on the creation endpoints for customers, articles, and team members in , , and . The endpoints now return a structured 403 error on limit exhaustion.
    *   Updated the  endpoint in  to return the plan's user limit.
*   **Frontend**:
    *   Created placeholder files for the My Account feature: , , .
    *   Added the Mi Cuenta navigation link to the sidebar in .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic for data validation, SQLAlchemy ORM.
*   **Frontend**: React, React Router.
*   **Architecture**: REST API with a decoupled frontend. The backend handles business logic and plan limitations, communicating specific error codes to the frontend for a tailored user experience.

None identified at this stage.

**key api endpoints**
*   : Updates the current user's profile.
*   : Changes the current user's password.
*   : Creates a new customer (now returns 403 on limit).
*   : Creates a new article (now returns 403 on limit).
*   : Adds a new team member (now returns 403 on limit).
*   : Returns the current team member count and the plan limit.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
The backend has been modified to return a specific error response when a user hits a plan limit: a  status code with a JSON body like . The frontend work must now focus on intercepting this specific error to trigger a user-facing upgrade modal. The work on the My Account page is also halfway done, requiring the routing and component logic to be completed.
